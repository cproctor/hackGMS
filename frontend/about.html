            <b> Hi! This is the prototype for our webpage. We believe that a simple website with simple colors and a 
            good, well designed logo would be best!</b>
            <p>hackGMS will be a program designed by middle-schoolers to change the way our school—the Girls' Middle School—works.</p>
            <p>In the words of our fearless leader, Chris Proctor:</p>
            <i>We will create a “message board” web application for daily announcements, to be displayed on screens around the school.
            Parents will be able to send a text while parked in the traffic line to alert girls to meet their ride.</i>
            <p>For more information on the work that will go into the project, check out <a href="https://github.com/cproctor/hackGMS">our Github repository!</a></p>
            <p>Here is a Scratch project about our project!</p>
