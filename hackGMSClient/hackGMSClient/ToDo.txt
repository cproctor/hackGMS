Features (in rough order of importance)
If the CoreLocation manager tells us we are not authorized to use CL, we should alert the user and move the Automatic switch back to off
Figure out password and auth details
Add ability to delete messages that the user posted
Add some colors and make it looks nicer
Only leave preferences once the user has provided a first and last name
On each message send and fetch, the client should send along a unique device identifier. This would allow the server to build an "ignore" list for abusers
Get a version that runs in Spanish
Add a field in prefs for developers to specify a test server URL

Bugs (in rough order of importance)
Get the preferences UI to flow correctly when rotating the phone
Fix alignment of the buttons in the header
Don't allow posting if the user does not have a name specified
When pulling down to refresh, I want the spinning gear below the header, not above it
Figure out the right text encoding to use with JSON data to get rid of that odd warning in the console

Refactoring:
Put the header view (text input, button, and info button) into it's own XIB so it's easier to edit

Project tasks
Make an icon
Set project to work with iOS 7 or later (maybe back to iOS 6 if we can find devices to test with)


Testing Tasks:
Test on device with no cell modem
Test with really slow server (slow for POST and GET)
Test with massive number of messages
Test the app while driving on 101, West Bayshore, both directions. App should trigger only when in the driveway
Test to verify the app works when not frontmost, and when not running
Teston iPhone 4S, 5S, 6, 6 plus
Test how the app works when the network is dead and/or flakey

Done:
The keyboard covers up the "Done" button when using preferences
On first time lauch, go straight to the prefs window
Add a preference to hit a test server.
Figure out why the text is garbled after dismissing the preferences window
