hackGMS
=======

Ten middle schoolers set out to create a web application that will change the way our 
school works. Check back for updates! (We need a better description here...)

Get set up
----------
We are going to use **git**, a version control system, to share changes we make to 
this project. Whenever you make a change, you will use GitHub for Mac to **commit** your
changes. You're going to need GitHub for Mac:

1. Download GitHub for Mac (https://mac.github.com) and move the app to your Applications
   folder.
2. Open GitHub for Mac. It will ask you to sign in--click the link to make an account.
   Use your GMS email address, and make up a username. 
3. Once you finish making your account, sign in to GitHub for Mac. 
4. Using your web browser, go to the project page for HackGMS 
   (You're probably on it right now, but just in case the URL is https://github.com/cproctor/hackGMS)
5. Click the "Clone in Desktop" button at the bottom of the right sidebar. It will ask
   you where you want to save the project--you can put it anywhere you want on your 
   computer.
6. Make sure Chris adds you as a collaborator. He will need to know your GitHub username.
   
That's it. Now you can work on your project on your computer, and share your work with
everyone else.

Making changes
--------------

Once you have GitHub for Mac installed on your computer, you can just go about your 
business, making changes to the project. When you are ready to share the changes to 
everyone else, just press "sync" in GitHub for Mac. Make sure you sync before you start
working, and commit/sync often--if you are working on an old copy, your changes may be lost.
