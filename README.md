hackGMS
=======

Ten middle schoolers set out to create a web application that will change the way our 
school works. The hackGMS app is running at http://104.131.148.123/

Get set up
----------
We are going to use **git**, a version control system, to share changes we make to 
this project. Whenever you make a change, you will use GitHub for Mac to **commit** your
changes. You're going to need GitHub for Mac:

1. Download GitHub for Mac (https://mac.github.com) and move the app to your Applications
   folder.
2. Open GitHub for Mac. It will ask you to sign in--click the link to make an account.
   Use your GMS email address, and make up a username. 
3. Once you finish making your account, sign in to GitHub for Mac. 
4. Using your web browser, go to the project page for HackGMS 
   (You're probably on it right now, but just in case the URL is https://github.com/cproctor/hackGMS)
5. Click the "Clone in Desktop" button at the bottom of the right sidebar. It will ask
   you where you want to save the project--you can put it anywhere you want on your 
   computer.
6. Make sure Chris adds you as a collaborator. He will need to know your GitHub username.
   
That's it. Now you can work on your project on your computer, and share your work with
everyone else.

Making changes
--------------

Once you have GitHub for Mac installed on your computer, you can just go about your 
business, making changes to the project using TextWrangler. GitHub for Mac watches these 
files--every time you change a file and save it, you will also see the change show up in 
GitHub for Mac. After you make a change, use GitHub for Mac to commit it by leaving a 
message explaining what change you made. 

When you are ready to share the changes to everyone else, just press "Sync" in the top 
right corner of GitHub for Mac. Make sure you sync before you start
working, and commit/sync often--if you are working on an old copy, your changes may conflict
with changes someone else is making at the same time.

Seeing the changes you made
---------------------------

You can always run the site from your own computer. For details, see running_the_server.md
in the backend folder. 
The hackGMS live website lives here: http://burks.girlsms.org:5000/ However, 
it doesn't automatically update (yet). If you want your changes to show up on the live website,
<<<<<<< HEAD
ask Chris to stop the server, pull the latest changes, and restart the server.
>>>>>>> FETCH_HEAD
