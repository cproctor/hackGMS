            What's with these funny codes? This program might be run on various different computers, 
            which means the URL for things like stylesheets would be different. The double curly 
            brackets mean we are inserting a generated value. In this case, we are using Flask's
            url_for function to figure out the right URL for the file and drop that in.

        <h1>Hack GMS</h1>
        <p>hackGMS will be a program designed by middle-schoolers to change the way our school—the Girls' Middle School—works.</p>
        <p>In the words of our fearless leader, Chris Proctor:</p>
        <i>We will create a “message board” web application for daily announcements, to be displayed on screens around the school.
        Parents will be able to send a text while parked in the traffic line to alert girls to meet their ride.</i>
        <p> Hi! This is the prototype for our webpage. We believe that a simple website with simple colors and a 
        good, well designed logo would be best!</p>
