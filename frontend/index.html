            What's with these funny codes? This program might be run on various different computers, 
            which means the URL for things like stylesheets would be different. The double curly 
            brackets mean we are inserting a generated value. In this case, we are using Flask's
            url_for function to figure out the right URL for the file and drop that in.

        <p> Hi! This is the prototype for our webpage. We believe that a simple website with simple colors and a 
        good, well designed logo would be best!</p>
